I've dropped this project because I couldn't work around this error.

    Module Error (from ./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js):
    Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: Windows 64-bit with Unsupported runtime (108)

I will restart this project in a new github repo, without deleting this one.
